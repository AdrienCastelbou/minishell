# [42 cursus] Minishell

The goal of this project is to create a basic shell, with our own builtins (echo, cd, pwd, env, export, unset, exit), commands with relative/absolute path execution, fd redirections (<, >, >>), pipes, signals (ctrl + C, ctrl + D, ctrl + \\), and commands history using termcaps, using UP and DOWN arrows.

Because termcaps effects may vary and do strange things according the OS, the best way to play with this minishell is to run it on a Linux distribution.
